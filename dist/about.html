A lifelong lover of home fragrances and an advocate for sustainable living, Kim’s journey began with a simple desire—to create candles that not only smell divine but also bring joy, comfort, and mindfulness into every space they touch. </p> <p class="text-gray-600 mt-4"> With a background in design and a passion for craftsmanship, Kim hand-poured the very first New Vintage Luxury Candle in her small workshop. Inspired by nature’s beauty and timeless elegance, she carefully curated scents that evoke memories, feelings, and moments of tranquility. Every candle in our collection reflects her commitment to quality, sustainability, and artistry. </p> <p class="text-gray-600 mt-4"> Beyond creating products, Kim believes in making a positive impact. Under her guidance, New Vintage Luxury Candles is proud to champion eco-conscious practices, from using natural, biodegradable materials to supporting local artisans. Her mission is simple: to inspire others to light a candle and spark a little more warmth, love, and care in their lives. </p> <p class="text-gray-600 mt-4"> Join Kim on this journey to transform ordinary spaces into extraordinary sanctuaries, one candle at a time. </p> </div>
